L1:Task Management System
Total Objective
Develop an advanced Task Management System with logical CRUD operations. Implement validation logic using middleware, instead of schema validation. Ensure a proper project structure for better scalability and maintainability.

Setup Folder Structure

Maintain the following folder structure for better organization:
project-root/
├── models/           # Mongoose models
│   └── task.model.js
├── routes/           # Express routes
│   └── task.routes.js
├── config/           # Configuration files
│   └── db.js         # MongoDB connection logic
├── controllers/      # Controller logic
│   └── task.controller.js
├── middleware/       # Middleware logic
│   └── task.middleware.js  # Validation middleware
├── app.js            # Application entry point
└── package.json
MongoDB Configuration

config/db.js should handle the connection betwee the MongoDB & Node JS.
Task Model
Define a Task schema with the following fields:
title
description
priority
isCompleted
completionDate
dueDate
Middleware Validation (task.middleware.js)
Implement middleware to validate the following:

Atleast title, description, priority, should be there in the request body, if anyone is misisng, then middlweware should send a response stating Incomplete Data Received
Also the middlweare should check the field for priority should be low or medium or high
Advanced CRUD Operations
Create a New Task (POST /tasks):

Ensure title is unique.
check the field for priority should be low or medium or high, not other like LOW or High or Medium etc
Retrieve Tasks (GET /tasks):

get all the tasks
Update a Task (PATCH /tasks/:id):

Allow updation of title, priority or description
If isCompleted is set to true, automatically add the completionDate which will be the Current Date.
Ensure validation using middleware.
Delete Tasks (DELETE /tasks):

Allow bulk deletion of tasks filtered by priority.
Sample Routes in task.routes.js
POST /tasks: Add a new task with validation.
GET /tasks: Retrieve tasks with optional filtering by priority or status.
PATCH /tasks/:id: Update a task with completion logic.
DELETE /tasks: Delete tasks based on the priority filter.
